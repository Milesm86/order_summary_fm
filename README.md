## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Implement CSS Flexbox to center elements within the page and within the div containers that I created for the card component. Also, learned how to create a background image and put an overlay of color over the image.

### Continued development

Practice more styling wtih Flexbox on this project and I need to focus on how to style a webpage and its components more efficiently for the next projects that I work on.
